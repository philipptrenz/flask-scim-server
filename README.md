# Flask SCIM Server (Configured for use with Okta)
**NOTE:** This is not meant to be a fully-fledged, IDP-agnostic SCIM server. 

## Dependencies:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)

## Setting up the Flask app and Postgres DB
1.  Build and start docker containers with ```docker-compose up```
2.  Run the following commands to create migrations and tables in the ```scim``` database:
    - ```docker-compose exec server python manage.py db init```
    - ```docker-compose exec server python manage.py db migrate```
    - ```docker-compose exec server python manage.py db upgrade```

7. Everything should be setup now and you should now have your SCIM server running on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Setting up ngrok to route requests from Okta to localhost
- Once you have ngrok installed, run ```./ngrok http 5000``` to create a tunnel from ngrok to your http://127.0.0.1:5000. Copy the ```https``` Forwarding URL created by ngrok as you will need it later.

## Creating and configuring your Okta Application
- Now it's time to create a new SCIM integration in Okta. If your SCIM app(s) are already setup on the Okta side, feel free to skip ahead to **Test the SCIM Server**. There are two options that will work with this server, and I will ALWAYS recommend the first, which is using an Okta SCIM template application.

### Option 1: SCIM Template App

1. In your Okta dashboard, go to **Applications** -> **Applications**, then click the **Browse App Catalogue** button. Search for **SCIM 2.0 Test App (Header Auth)** and click the **Add** button once you have it pulled up.
2. In the **General Settings** tab, click **Next**.
3. We will set this up as a SWA application, so in the **Sign-On Options** tab, click **Secure Web Authentication**.
4. Click **Done**.
5. Tab over to **Provisioning** and click **Configure API Integration.**
6. Check **Enable API integration**.
7. In the Base URL field, paste in the ngrok url you generated above with **/scim/v2** appended to the end. In the API Token field, type **Bearer 123456789**. (Later on we will go over how to customize this auth header, but out-of-the-box, the SCIM server expects this value)
8. Click Test API Credentials and you should get a success message like the below:

![SCIM_1](https://i.imgur.com/iFaxU9G.png)

> You can navigate to `http://localhost:4040` to see the request from Okta on this request, as well as the response from the SCIM server.

![SCIM_2](https://i.imgur.com/gCht05S.png)

9. Click **Save**.

Now your **Provisoning** tab will look a bit different.

10. Click **Edit** next to **Provisioning to App** and check off:
    - Create Users
    - Update User Attributes
    - Deactivate Users
    
And **Save**.

### Option 2: Enable SCIM Provisioning for Existing AIW App

> Feel free to skip over this section to **Test the SCIM Server** if you set your SCIM integration up above.

1. In your Okta dashboard, go to **Applications** -> **Applications**, then click the **Create App Integration** button. For this setup we will select **SWA - Secure Web Authentication**. Click **Next**.
2. You can put whatever you'd like for the **App Name** and **App Login Page URL**, as we will just be loking at the SCIM functionality and not the SWA aspect of this app. Click **Finish**.
3. In the **General** tab of the app, click **Edit** and toggle Provisioning from **None** to **SCIM**. Click **Save**.
4. Your app should now have a **Provisioning** tab. Tab over to it and fill out the integration settings like the below image. Make the Authorization header **123456789**. You can change this later in the SCIM flask app.

![SCIM_4](https://i.imgur.com/yaEl9FD.png)

5. Click **Test Connector Configuration** and you should see the following success confirmation:

![SCIM_5](https://i.imgur.com/OetQUDR.png)

6. At which point, you can now click **Save**.

> You can navigate to `http://localhost:4040` to see the request from Okta on this request, as well as the response from the SCIM server.

![SCIM_6](https://i.imgur.com/gCht05S.png)


7. Now your **Provisoning** tab will look a bit different. Click **Edit** next to **Provisioning to App** and check off:
    - Create Users
    - Update User Attributes
    - Deactivate Users
    
And **Save**.

![SCIM_7](https://i.imgur.com/QzzUgHk.png)

You should now be set on the Okta side to start testing the SCIM server.

## Test the SCIM Server
>**Note**: I am using the SCIM template integration in the below steps. If you are using the AIW version, there may be subtle differences in some of the calls. More info [here](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/scim/scim-20/).

- Navigate to http://localhost:4040 to see all the requests and responses taking place between Okta and the SCIM server. I will be truncating mine a bit in the below examples for brevity.

- From the section above, you saw that we setup our SCIM integration with **Bearer 123456789** in the authorization header. You can change this header to whatever you'd like in the **app.py** file at the following line of function **auth_required**:

`if request.headers['Authorization'].split('Bearer ')[1] == '123456789':`

Replace '123456789' with whatever unique value you'd like and make sure to update this in the provisioning tab of your Okta integrations.

### Assign a User
Under the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** -> **Assign to People**. I assigned user **obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev**. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to my SCIM server:

 - *Okta Request:*
```
GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22obi-wan.kenobi%40iamciam.dev%22&startIndex=1&count=100
```
 - *SCIM Server Response:*
```
200 OK
```
```
{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
```
 - *Okta Request:*
```
POST /scim/v2/Users
```
```
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev",
    "name": {
        "givenName": "Obi-Wan",
        "familyName": "Kenobi"
    },
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "value": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev",
            "type": "work"
        }
    ],
    "displayName": "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "externalId": "00use6vjvehodmsQb4x6",
    "groups": [],
    "password": "gl^m&qWZ",
    "active": true
}
```
 - *SCIM Server Response:*
```
201 CREATED
```
```
{
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "type": "work",
            "value": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev"
        }
    ],
    "externalId": "00use6vjvehodmsQb4x6",
    "groups": [],
    "id": "289383d9-ff3a-48bb-99ea-3048762267c7",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
    },
    "name": {
        "familyName": "Kenobi",
        "givenName": "Obi-Wan",
        "middleName": null
    },
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "obi-wan.kenobi@iamciam.dev"
}
```

- Now If you navigate to your local **scim** database and run `select * from users;`, you should see the assigned user in the database.

![SCIM_8](https://i.imgur.com/Kno7Jy7.png)

### Unassign a User

Let's go ahead and unassign the user we just assigned in Okta. Under **Assignments**, click the **X** next to the user we just assigned:

![SCIM_9](https://i.imgur.com/M3UzFX4.png)

The request/response should look like this:
 - *Okta Request:*
```
PATCH /scim/v2/Users/289383d9-ff3a-48bb-99ea-3048762267c7
```
```
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:PatchOp"
    ],
    "Operations": [
        {
            "op": "replace",
            "value": {
                "active": false
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
 - *SCIM Server Response:*
```
204 NO CONTENT
```

- And sure enough, if you run that same `select * from users;` in the scim db, you will see the user is now `active: false`:

![SCIM_10](https://i.imgur.com/OjS9piE.png)

### Assign a Group
Under the **Assignments** tab, click **Assign** -> **Assign to Groups**. I assigned group **Droids**. Note that this acts similar to the above assigning of individual users. Okta will iterate through the group membership and create them in the external SCIM server - but the Group itself won't be made. That is done in **Push Groups** which we will handle later. Here is a look at the requests and responses from Okta to my SCIM server:

 - *Okta Request:*
```
GET /scim/v2/Users?filter=userName%20eq%20%22c-3po%40iamciam.dev%22&startIndex=1&count=100
```
 - *SCIM Server Response:*
```
200 OK
```
```
{
    "Resources": [],
    "itemsPerPage": 0,
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:api:messages:2.0:ListResponse"
    ],
    "startIndex": 1,
    "totalResults": 0
}
```
 - *Okta Request:*
```
POST /scim/v2/Users
```
```
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "c-3po@iamciam.dev",
    "name": {
        "givenName": "C",
        "familyName": "3PO"
    },
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "value": "c-3po@iamciam.dev",
            "type": "work"
        }
    ],
    "displayName": "C 3PO",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "externalId": "00usemeo53HWWPYy14x6",
    "groups": [],
    "password": "wA&&cprB",
    "active": true
}
```
 - *SCIM Server Response:*
```
201 CREATED
```
```
{
    "active": true,
    "displayName": "C 3PO",
    "emails": [
        {
            "primary": true,
            "type": "work",
            "value": "c-3po@iamciam.dev"
        }
    ],
    "externalId": "00usemeo53HWWPYy14x6",
    "groups": [],
    "id": "478c4cf4-1aa3-41a1-93da-4c154c5955e0",
    "locale": "en-US",
    "meta": {
        "resourceType": "User"
    },
    "name": {
        "familyName": "3PO",
        "givenName": "C",
        "middleName": null
    },
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:User"
    ],
    "userName": "c-3po@iamciam.dev"
}
```

- There are 3 members in my **Droids** group: C-3P0, R2-D2 and BB-8. The above req/resp chain repeats for the other 2 users. Now when I run `select * from users;` in the scim database I can see the assigned users:

![SCIM_11](https://i.imgur.com/qw5bnQ9.png)

### Push Groups

As mentioned above, assigning a group in Okta only adds the users to my SCIM server, not the Group itself. In order to add the Group, tab over to **Push Groups** in your Okta app integration. Click **Push Groups** -> **Find groups by name** and select the group you assigned above. **Make sure Push group memberships immediately** is checked and click **Save**. Two calls should be made by Okta - one creating the group itself and another updating the group membership. Here are the requests and responses for my Droids group push:

 - *Okta Request:*
```
POST /scim/v2/Groups
```
```
{
    "schemas": [
        "urn:ietf:params:scim:schemas:core:2.0:Group"
    ],
    "displayName": "Droids",
    "members": [
        {
            "value": "cc2573a1-e1c4-491d-a3db-ae4a2e078d61",
            "display": "bb-8@iamciam.dev"
        },

        },
        {
            "value": "34e14e58-f0fe-4e9d-aeb2-0da25fa6626d",
            "display": "r2-d2@iamciam.dev"

    },
    "schemas": [

    ]
}
 ```
 
 - And with this, you should now see your group in the scim database after running `select * from groups;`:
 
![SCIM_12](https://i.imgur.com/DWLnWEl.png)
 
 As well as a link table which displays the many-to-many relationship between the users and groups. You can see this with `select * from link;`:

This covers the basic functionality of SCIM integration from Okta. Other use-cases haven't been tested extensively and may need tweaking over time.
